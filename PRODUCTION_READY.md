## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Data Layer:**
- All models include `TenantId`
- Database queries automatically scoped
- Composite indexes for performance

**Storage Layer:**
- MinIO buckets: `tenant-{id}-{type}`
- Complete bucket-level isolation
- Automatic provisioning

**Search Layer:**
- OpenSearch indexes: `tenant-{id}-{type}`
- Index-level data isolation
- Tenant-scoped queries

**Pipeline:**
- `TenantId` required in `PipelineContext`
- All 8 steps tenant-aware
- Tenant context preserved throughout

**Background Jobs:**
- BackupService tenant-scoped
- FileSyncService tenant-aware
- All jobs log tenant information

### Observability Stack

**Health Checks:**
```
GET /health          → All dependencies
GET /health/ready    → Database & cache
GET /health/live     → Application status
```

**Logging:**
- Structured JSON logs
- Correlation ID per request
- Tenant context in every log
- Performance metrics included
- File location: `logs/silo-{date}.log`

**Monitoring:**
- Health check metrics
- Request/response timing
- Background job statistics
- System resource tracking
