In summary, the report proposes a scalable, containerized .NET-based system for storing and indexing millions of files. The solution leverages MinIO for high-performance S3-compatible object storage, OpenSearch for distributed search and indexing capabilities, and Hangfire for resilient background processing and AI-driven metadata enrichment. Together, these components create a robust foundation for ingesting, tagging, and retrieving diverse file types at scale, while a lightweight .NET agent uses FileSystemWatcher and rsync to synchronize directories efficiently across platforms.
